# ArcusTangens

### Assignment, class and language
This is my solution to the assignment **ArcusTangens** of class **software developement 1,** written in Java. 

### Requirements
For this assignment I had to compute the arctangent of a given number x (x must be a double value between 0 and 1), which I get from the terminal. The arctangent should be computed with an accuracy of `EPSILON = 1E-16`. At the end, I had to compare my result with the result computed by the library function Math.atan(x).
