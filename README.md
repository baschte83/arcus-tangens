# ArcusTangens

###### Short description
This is the solution to the task ArcusTangens of my class software developement 1. 


###### What to do
For this task i had to compute the arctangent of a given number x, which we get from the console. The arctangent should be computed with an accuracy of `EPSILON = 1E-16`. At the end, i had to compare my result with the result computed by the library function Math.atan(x).
