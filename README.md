# ArcusTangens

### Short description
This is the solution to the task **ArcusTangens** of my class **software developement 1.** 


### What to do
For this task I had to compute the arctangent of a given number x, which I get from the terminal. The arctangent should be computed with an accuracy of `EPSILON = 1E-16`. At the end, I had to compare my result with the result computed by the library function Math.atan(x).
